# Infomedia: Frontend case 2022
It is no secret that Infomedia works a lot with articles and a lot of data surrounding these. Naturally one of the most repeating UI elements we build is the "Article list" and "Article" elements.

The article list element is a list of entries with a preview of an article, such as the article headline and a short summary. The article element is a full view of the article, containing the entire text and other metadata.

Articles in our domain are not just traditional newspaper articles, these can be web articles, speech-to-text interactive broadcast (radio, TV, podcast) articles, social media content and so on. This means depending on the type of the article we can display different data alongside the main body text, e.g., web articles have direct links to the original article, broadcast articles have a video player and print articles have the original PDF view included. In the article list and on the article itself we usually display helpful metadata like, date of the article, publisher, author, type of the article and so forth.

The goal of this case is for you to  **describe**  how you would build this –  _and if you do build something, we’d love to get a walk-through of your code_. To serve as an inspiration here’s a list of topics you could consider: document structure, semantics, styling, frameworks, tools, routing, testing, rendering, accessibility, performance, composition/inheritance, data fetching, responsiveness.

To help you with the case, there’s a data snippet attached to help you build and understand the data we work with. You can find it here: [https://github.com/InfomediaGroup/frontend-case-2022](https://github.com/InfomediaGroup/frontend-case-2022) and you are very welcome to fork it and even submit your thoughts/solution as a PR.
